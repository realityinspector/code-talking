Dineh / Navajo Translator Prototype
About

This project is a prototype of a web-based translation tool designed to translate English phrases into the Navajo/Diné language. Leveraging HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (including Alpine.js and jQuery), and Python, this tool aims to provide an educational and interactive experience for users interested in the Navajo language and culture. It also includes a unique feature to make conversations public, fostering a community of learners and enthusiasts.
Features

Translation Interface: Users can input English phrases and receive translations in the Navajo/Diné language.

Interactive Conversation: Through an intuitive web interface, users can have a simulated conversation with the assistant, which translates phrases in real-time.

Public Conversations: Users have the option to make their conversations public, sharing their learning journey with others.

Educational Insights: Alongside translations, users receive explanations about the Navajo/Diné language, including syntax, semantics, and cultural nuances.
